### About

Everybody wants to create their own code evaluation system and add some unique features that are missing from other systems. Since 2013, CSES has been used to organize several programming courses and contests in Finland.

The CSES Problem Set is a collection of competitive programming practice problems.

The goal of the project is to create a comprehensive high quality problem set for learning competitive programming. The current collection has 200 problems, and new problems will be gradually added.

Languages

You can solve problems in several languages, including C++, Java, and Python. More information about available languages is here.

Hacking

After solving a problem, you can view the solutions by other users and try to hack them by giving a test case where the solution fails. If your hack is successful, the new test case will be added to the test data and all submissions will be regraded.

Books

The problem set has been designed so that you can use it together with recent competitive programming books, listed here. The books discuss techniques and ideas that are useful when solving the problems.
